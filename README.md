# Recipe Website  

>This will be, for now, a simplistic site where users can input their own recipes, retrieve random recipes, and retrieve them in various catagories, >?such as by popularity, cost, number of ingredients, etc. I want this to be clean, I cannot tell you how many times I have had to scroll through a 2000+ word blog post in order to find the recipe at the end. Simple, clean UI, one box describing ingredients, one box showing a gallery of the food, one box showing nutrition values, one showing things like yield, cook time, etc. and one showing the actual instructions.  
At some point, some features I would like to add:
------------------------------
- **Checklist**- A place where the user could add and delete the items they have in their kitchen which could then be used to suggest things the user could make.
- **Shopping list** - An additional shopping list section, where the user could make their own shopping list, these things, as they're checked off, could be added to the kitchen's inventory of items. Could also, 

>And in the far far future, maybe even integration with other devices like apps or an alexa app where ingredients could be ammended or removed by a simple sentence.
